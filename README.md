## General comments
* The project was initialised with create-react-app, which means all the build scripts are provided by react-scripts.
* Using material-ui was a requirement, this is my first attempt at it.
* Some elements in the layout have 'data-qa' attributes assigned to them. I've used this attribute to access the rendered data from the tests using Enzyme. In future these attributes can be used in automated acceptance tests build for example with Selenium or TestCafe.
* Task description did not mention mobile devices and pixel-perfect layout, so no support for mobile devises is provided.
* Task description did not mention any ADA requirements.

## Areas of improvement
### UI
* Provide special layout for mobile devices
* Add screen-reader support
* Consider using specialised material-ui components to give the user nicer feedback in negative scenarios

#### Code and Project setup
* Add automated UI tests with Selenium or TestCafe, for example
* Consider using Flow static type annotations or migrate to TypeScript
* Consider adding jest snapshot testing.
* Consider changing the way files are imported, right now project uses relative paths with a lot of jumping from directory to directory. As the project grows, handling more and more complex paths for file inclusion will become tedious. It would be nicer to use imports relative to the main package. 
* Verify the built bundle and address performance issues, if any

##
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
